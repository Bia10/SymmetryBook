\section{The integers}
\label{sec:integers}

We define the type of integers in one of the many possible ways.

\begin{definition}\label{def:integers}
Let $\zet$ be the inductive type with the following three constructors:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\zzero: \zet$ for the integer number zero, 
$0 \defeq \zzero$
\item $\zpos: \NN \to \zet$ for positive numbers,
$1 \defeq \zpos(0),\ldots$.
\item $\zneg: \NN \to \zet$ for negative numbers, 
$-1 \defeq \zneg(0),\ldots$
\end{enumerate}

The \emph{embedding} function $i:\NN\to\zet$ is defined by induction,
setting $i(0)\defeq \zzero$, $i(S(n))\defeq \zpos(n)$.
Like the type $\NN$, the type $\zet$ is a set with decidable equality
and ordering relations,
and we denote its elements often in the usual way as $\ldots,-1,0,1,\ldots$.

One well-known equivalence is \emph{negation} ${-}:\zet\to\zet$, 
also called \emph{complement}, inductively defined by setting 
$-\zzero\defeq \zzero$, 
$-\zpos(n)\defeq \zneg(n)$, 
$-\zneg(n)\defeq \zpos(n)$.
Negation is its own inverse.

The \emph{successor} function $s:\zet\to\zet$ is defined inductively setting 
$s(\zzero)\defeq \zpos(0)$, 
$s(\zpos(n))\defeq \zpos(S(n))$,
$s(\zneg(n))\defeq -i(n)$. For example, we have
$s(-1)\jdeq s(\zneg(0))\jdeq -i(0) \jdeq \zzero \jdeq 0$.
By induction on $n:\NN$ one proves $s(i(n))=i(S(n))$, 
so that one can say that $s$ extends $S$
on the $i$-image of $\NN$. 

The successor function $s$ is an equivalence.
It is instructive to depict iterating $s$ in both directions as 
a doubly infinite sequence containing all integers:
\[
\ldots \mapsto \zneg(1) \mapsto \zneg(0) \mapsto \zzero \mapsto \zpos(0) \mapsto \zpos(1) \mapsto \ldots
\]

The inverse $s^{-1}$ of $s$ is called the \emph{predecessor} function.
We denote the $n$-fold iteration of $s$ as $s^n$, and
the $n$-fold iteration of $s^{-1}$ as $s^{-n}$.

Addition of integers is defined inductively by setting
$z + \zzero\defeq z$, 
$z + \zpos(n)\defeq s^{n+1}(z)$, 
$z + \zneg(n)\defeq s^{-(n+1)}(z)$.
Again, addition extends $+$ on the $i$-image of $\NN$,
see \cref{xca:addition-on-Z-and-N}. 
From addition and unary $-$ one can define a binary
\emph{substraction} function setting $z-y \defeq z+(-y)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{xca}\label{xca:addition-on-Z-and-N}
Show that $i(n+m)=i(n)+i(m)$ for all $n,m:\NN$.
\end{xca}


\section{Some induction principles for the integers}
\label{sec:integers-induction}

From the definition of $\zet$ we get the following slightly better induction principle:
Given $P : \zet \to \UU$, to construct an element of $P(z)$ for every $z : \zet$,
it suffices to give $P(0)$ and two functions
$f : \prod_{n:\NN}(P(n) \to P(n+1))$ and
$g : \prod_{n:\NN}(P(-n) \to P(-n-1))$,
see \cref{fig:integers-induction-asymmetric}.

      }
    }
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Symmetric integer induction principle}
  \label{fig:integers-induction-symmetric}
\end{figure}

It's possible to give a more symmetric, but less general induction principle,
we if assume that the functions are equivalences,
but in this case we can reorient the $g$'s to point in the same direction as the $f$'s,
so that we just give $f : \prod_{z:\zet}P(z) \equiv P(z+1)$, see \cref{fig:integers-induction-symmetric}.

We shall need that in this case, giving a element $h:\prod_{z:\zet}P(z)$
such that $h(z+1) = f_z(h(z))$ for all $z:\zet$
is in fact equivalent to giving the single element $h(0)$.
We formulate this precisely as follows.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:integers-univ-symm}
  Let $P : \zet \to \UU$ and $f : \prod_{z:\zet}P(z) \equiv P(z+1)$. The function
  \[
    \varphi : \biggl(\sum_{h:\prod_{z:\zet}P(z)}\prod_{z:\zet}h(z+1) = f_z(h(z))\biggr) \to P(0)
  \]
  that sends $(h,q)$ to $h(0)$ is an equivalence.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  We prove that the fiber over any $p : P(0)$ is contractible.
  This fiber consists of a pair $(h,q)$ and an identification $r : h(0) = p$.
  Note that giving $h$ by itself is equivalent to giving $h_0 : P(0)$, $h_+ : \prod_{n:\NN}P(n+1)$,
  and $h_- : \prod_{n:\NN} P(-n-1)$. Then $r : h_0 = p$,
  and the pair $(h_0,r)$ contracts away,
  so we're left with the type
  \begin{align*}
    \varphi^{-1}(p)
    &\equiv
      \Biggl(\sum_{h_+ : \prod_{n:\NN}P(n+1)}
      \bigl(h_+(0) = f_0(p)\bigr) \\
    &\qquad\qquad\qquad
      \times \biggl(\prod_{n:\NN}h_+(n+1) = f_n(h_+(n))\biggr)\Biggr) \\
    &\quad\times
      \Biggl(\sum_{h_- : \prod_{n:\NN}P(-n-1)}
      \bigl(h_-(0) = f_{-1}^{-1}(p)\bigr) \\
    &\qquad\qquad\qquad
      \times \biggl(\prod_{n:\NN}h_-(n+1) = f_{-n-2}^{-1}(h_-(n))\biggr)\Biggr).
  \end{align*}
  The latter type is contractible, because it is the product of two contractible types,
  each specifying a certain function $h_{\pm}:\prod_{n:\NN}Q_{\pm}(n)$,
  and saying that this function has a certain value at $0$
  and prescribing the values at successors.
  But such a specification is unique by the universal property (induction!) of $\NN$.
\end{proof}
Let us analyze the inverse function produced in the proof.
It maps $p : P(0)$ to the function that takes $z:\zet$ to $f^z(p):P(z)$, where
\begin{alignat*}2
  f^0(p) &\defeq p, && \\
  f^{n+1}(p) &\defeq f_n(f^n(p)),&\quad&\text{for $n:\NN$,} \\
  f^{-n-1}(p) &\defeq f_{-n-1}^{-1}(f^{-n}(p)),&\quad&\text{for $n:\NN$.}
\end{alignat*}

\section{The integers as a group}
\label{sec:integers-group}

In the previous section we first defined the \emph{set}
of integers $\zet$. Then we defined functions that add
algebraic stucture to $\zet$ (the structure of a free group 
with one generator). In this section we
show that this structure can also be obtained from the
symmetries of a certain element in a certain type.
This is one of the keypoints of this book, 
therefore pointed out early on.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:one-orbit-int}
Let $s$ be as in \cref{def:integers}, and 
let $f:\zet\to\zet$ be such that $f\circ s = s\circ f$. 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{item-one-orbit} For all $z:\zet$ there is a unique $n:\NN$
such that either $z=s^{-(n+1)}(0)$, or $z=s^{n}(0)$.
  \item\label{item-f(0)-nonneg} For all $n:\NN$, if $f(0)=s^{n}(0)$, then $f=s^{n}$.
  \item\label{item-f(0)-nonpos} For all $n:\NN$, if $f(0)=s^{-n}(0)$, then $f=s^{-n}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
From $f\circ s = s\circ f$ we get $f\circ s^n = s^n\circ f$
and $f\circ s^{-n} = s^{-n}\circ f$ by induction on $n:\NN$.

(\ref{item-one-orbit}) Induction on $n:\NN$ proves $s^{n}(0)=n$, 
as well as $s^{-n}(0)=-n$. Uniqueness is easy.

(\ref{item-f(0)-nonneg}) Assume $f(0)=s^{n}(0)$.  
Given $z:\zet$, let $m$ be such that either $z=s^{m}(0)$, 
or $z=s^{-(m+1)}(0)$. In the first case we calculate
\[
f(z)=f(s^{m}(0))=s^{m}(f(0))=s^{m}(s^{n}(0))=s^{n}(s^{m}(0))= s^{n}(z),
\]
so that $f=s^{n}$ by function extensionality. 
The second case is very similar;
(\ref{item-f(0)-nonpos}) goes like (\ref{item-f(0)-nonneg}).
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:pre-torsor-int}
We have $\zet\equiv \sum_{f:\zet\to\zet} (f\circ s = s\circ f)$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
First observe that $f\circ s = s\circ f$ is a true proposition
for all $f=s^n$ and $f=s^{-n}$. Recall that proofs of propositions
may be left out from dependent pairs. Thus we
define $e : \zet\to \sum_{f:\zet\to\zet} (f\circ s = s\circ f)$ 
inductively by setting 
$e(\zzero)\defeq \id_\zet$, 
$e(\zpos(n))\defeq s^{n+1}$,
$e(\zneg(n))\defeq s^{-(n+1)}$.
By \cref{lem:one-orbit-int}, $e$ is a well-defined equivalence.
\end{proof}

Again by \cref{lem:one-orbit-int}, if $f\circ s = s\circ f$,
then $f: \zet\to\zet$ is an equivalence. 
Using UA, we get by \cref{cor:pre-torsor-int} the equivalence
\[
\zet\equiv \sum_{f:\zet=\zet} (f\circ s \circ f^{-1} = s).
\]
Recall that $f\circ s \circ f^{-1}$ is transport of $s$ by
conjugation with $f$. Using the characterization of equality 
in $\Sigma$-types from \cite[Theorem 2.7.2]{hottbook} we get the equivalence
\[
\zet\equiv ((\zet,s) = (\zet,s)).
\]
One particular equivalence is $e$ from the proof
of \cref{cor:pre-torsor-int}, with inverse $e^{-1}$.
We have $e^{-1}(\id_\zet) = 0$.
The type $(\zet,s) = (\zet,s)$ of symmetries of $(\zet,s)$
has a natural algebraic structure called path-algebra
induced by composing and taking inverses (of paths,
and modulo UA also of equivalences), and $\refl{(\zet,s)}$
(the identity equivalence).
%if $f,g:(\zet,s) = (\zet,s)$, then $f\circ g:(\zet,s) = (\zet,s)$.
%Moreover, elements of $(\zet,s) = (\zet,s)$ have inverses.
This algebraic structure is transported by $e^{-1}$ to $\zet$
and gives exactly the group structure defined by ${+},{-},0$.

One important issue has been ignored up to now:
What is the type of $(\zet,s)$? 
One possible answer is: $\sum_{X:\UU}(X=X)$.
The following exercise shows that we do not get the 
property that $(X,f)=(X,f)$ is equivalent to
$(\zet,s) = (\zet,s)$ for all $(X,f) : \sum_{X:\UU}(X=X)$.
It is for this reason that in the next section
another choice will be made.

\begin{xca}\label{xca:zet-symmetries}
Figure out the symmetries of $(\zet,\id_\zet)$ (easy) and 
of $(\zet,s^2)$ (hard).
\end{xca}

\section{Z-Torsors}\label{sec:ZTorsors}

In this section, pairs $(X,f)$ have type $\sum_{X:\UU}(X\to X)$
without explicitly mentioning this. Moreover, terms of
propositional type that do not interest us are denoted by $!$,
or even left out alltogether. Nested pairs may be written as tuples.

\begin{definition}\label{sec:ZTors}
The pointed type of $\zet$-torsors is defined by
\[
\TorZ\defeq \sum_{(X,f)}\Trunc{(\zet,s)=(X,f)} \text{~with~}
\pt\defeq ((\zet,s),\trunc{\refl{(\zet,s)}}).
\]
\end{definition}
Note that $\Trunc{(\zet,s)=(X,f)}$ has propositional consequences
such as $\isset(X)$ and $\isEq(f)$.

Our type $\TorZ$ is equivalent to the more traditionally defined type of $\ZZ$-torsors, $\Xtorsor{\ZZ}$, but is more parsimonious.
Another way to think of it is as the type of Cayley diagrams for $\ZZ$.

The aim of this section is to show that $\TorZ$ has the
universal property of the circle.

Although the same method works to derive both the recursion and the induction principles,
we opt to do the recursion principle first,
as it is slightly simpler,
and prepares the way for the more complicated induction principle.

Fix $A:\UU$, $a:A$ and $p: a=_A a$. 
We are going to define types and
functions depending on this input, and will use $p$ in various
denotations to express this dependence. 

We would like to construct an element of $A$ for every $(X,f,t):\TorZ$ (depending on $a$ and $p$).
In order to make use of $t:\Trunc{(\zet,s)=(X,f)}$, we need to find a proposition.
The idea is to expand $A$ to a $\Sigma$-type over $A$ that we can then show to be contractible.

\begin{definition}\label{def:TBN}
For every $(X,f)$, define
\begin{align*}\label{eq:TBD}
Q_p(X,f)&\defeq \sum_{a':A}~\sum_{h:X\to a=a'}~\prod_{x:X} h(f(x))=p\ct h(x).
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:guided-null-hmtps}
For every $(X,f,t):\TorZ$, the type $Q_p(X,f)$ is contractible
with center $c_p(X,f,t)$ defined in the proof.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $(X,f,t):\TorZ$. Since we are going to prove a proposition,
  we may take $t\jdeq\trunc e$ for some $e : (\zet,s)=(X,f)$.
  By induction on $e$, it suffices to prove that $Q_p(\zet,s)$ is contractible.

  Note that $Q_p(\zet,s)$ is the total space of the family $R_p : A \to \UU$ defined by
  \[
    R_p(a') \defeq \sum_{h:\zet \to a=a'}~\prod_{z:\zet} h(f(z))=p\ct h(z).
  \]
  Thus, to show that $Q_p(\zet,s)$ is contractible,
  it suffices to define an equivalence
  \[
    \varphi_{a'} : \biggl(\sum_{h:\zet \to a=a'}\prod_{z:\zet} h(f(z))=p\ct h(z)\biggr) \xrightarrow{\sim}{} (a=a')
  \]
  for each $a':A$.
  The intention is now to invoke \cref{thm:integers-univ-symm}.
  Indeed, let us define $S_{a'}\defeq(a=a')$
  and $g_{a'} : (a=a') \to (a=a')$ by $g_{a'}(q) \defeq p \ct q$.
  Then $g_{a'}$ is an equivalence (with inverse $q \mapsto p^{-1}\ct q$).
  Thus, \cref{thm:integers-univ-symm} applied to the constant family at $S_{a'}$ over $\zet$
  with the equivalences given by $g_{a'}$,
  shows that $\varphi_{a'}$ is an equivalence,
  where $\varphi_{a'}(h,q) \defeq h(0)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def:TBN}
For every $Z:\TorZ$, define
\begin{align*}\label{eq:TBD}
\hat{p}(Z)&\defeq (a',h), 
\text{~where $c_p(Z)\jdeq (a',h,!)$;}\\
\bar{p}(Z)&\defeq \pi_1 (\hat{p}(Z)).
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

Recall $\pt\defeq (\zet,s,\trunc{\refl{(\zet,s)}})$.
A straightforward calculation gives 
$\bar{p}(\pt)\jdeq \pi_1 (c_p(\pt)) \jdeq a$, which is one important
aspect of the universal property that we are after.
The second component of $\hat p(\pt)$ maps $z$ to $p^z$.
Before we can deal with the other aspect we have to prepare first.

There is a natural path $\pt =_\TorZ \pt$ obtained from $s$
by applying UA.
Using \cite[Theorem 2.7.2]{hottbook} we can analyse this path
componentwise. 

The first component must be a path of type $\zet=\zet$,
and we denote this path by $ua(s)$. 

The second component must now be
a path of type $ua(s)_*\, s = s$. The type family in which the transport
takes place is $X\mapsto (X\to X)$. This means transport by conjugation,
so we have to prove $s\circ s \circ s^{-1} = s$, which is easy.

The third component is a path in a contractible type, which always exists.

Instead of $(ua(s),!,!)$ we denote the path by $\Zloop$.
Modulo the equivalence from \cite[Theorem 2.7.2]{hottbook} we can wrap up:
\[
\Zloop : \pt =_\TorZ \pt
%\Zloop : (\zet,s,\trunc{\refl{(\zet,s)}}) = (\zet,s,\trunc{\refl{(\zet,s)}})
\]

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:TBN}
The following equations are well-typed and true:
\[
(a,n\mapsto p^{n-1}) = \Zloop_*\, (a,n\mapsto p^n) = (a,n\mapsto p^n).
\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We have $\apd{\hat{p}}(\Zloop) : \Zloop_*\,\hat{p}(\pt) = \hat{p}(\pt)$,
and $\hat{p}(\pt) \jdeq (a,n\mapsto p^n)$. This proves the second equation.
The first equation follows by a careful analysis of the type families
in which the transport takes place. In constant type families, transport
is the identity function. In the type family $X\mapsto (X\to a=a)$,
the transport along $ua(s)$ amounts to precomposition with $s^{-1}$,
which proves the first equation.
\end{proof}

For the following lemma we once more 
invoke \cite[Theorem 2.7.2]{hottbook}, in particular
the equivalence $pair^=$ and its inverse $f$ from the proof.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:TBN}
For all $q:(a,n\mapsto p^{n-1}) = (a,n\mapsto p^n)$ we have $q=pair^=(p,!)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The first component of $f(q)$ is a path $p':a=a$,
and the second component is a path 
$p'_*\, (n\mapsto p^{n-1}) = (a,n\mapsto p^n)$.
Again we must be careful about the type family in which the
transport takes place. This is the type
family $x\mapsto \zet\to a=x$. 
This means the transport along $p'$ is composition with $p'$ on the right.
Taking $n=0$ yields $p^{-1}\ct p' = \refl{a}$, so $p'=p$.
It follows that $q=pair^=(p,!)$.
\end{proof}

Combining several of the previous results with 
$\bar{p}\jdeq \pi_1 \circ \hat{p}$, and abstracting from the
parameters, we obtain a recursor for $\TorZ$.

\begin{definition}\label{def:TorZrecursor}
The function $e_A(a,p) \defeq \bar{p}$ has type
\[
e_A : \sum_{a:A}(a=a) \to (\TorZ \to A),
\]
plus $e_A(a,p)(\pt) \jdeq \bar{p}(\pt) \jdeq a$ and 
$\ap{e_A(a,p)}(\Zloop)\jdeq\ap{\bar{p}}(\Zloop) = p$.
\end{definition}

The above definition is one half of a universal property.
The other half is showing that $e_A$ is an equivalence.
The obvious candidate for an inverse is 
$g\mapsto (g(\pt),\ap{g}(\Zloop))$.
The homotopy for the roundtrip starting in $\sum_{a:A}(a=a)$
is precisely the justification of \cref{def:TorZrecursor}.
The other homotopy amounts to showing
$e_A(g(\pt),\ap{g}(\Zloop)) = g$, for any $g:\TorZ\to A$.
We know already that both functions agree in $\pt$,
and that $\TorZ$ is connected, so that all function values
are merely equal. This simple argument would suffice if
$A$ is a set but not in general. We are facing a similar
problem as was solved in the proof of \cref{lem:guided-null-hmtps}.
The idea is to go one dimension up with the null homotopies.
First some auxiliary notations.

\begin{definition}\label{def:loop-s-iterated}
For every $Z\defeq(X,f,t):\TorZ$ and $x:X$, 
define $s^Z_x: \pt =_\TorZ Z$ by the equivalence $n\mapsto f^n(x)$ using UA. 
Using $t$, one can check $\isEq(n\mapsto f^n(x))$
and the other propositions involved. 
For simplicity, we denote $f^n(x)$ by $x+n$.
\end{definition}

The following lemma is proved by routine inductions.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:loop-s-iterated}
  For every $Z\defeq(X,f,t):\TorZ$, $x:X$ and $n:\zet$, 
  we have $s^Z_{x+1} = \Zloop \ct s^Z_x$. 
\end{lemma}

The following lemma uses pathovers and their composition, 
which should be defined somewhere else. 

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:concat-over}
  For every $A : \UU$, $B : A \to \UU$, $a_i:A$, $b_i:B(a_i)$ for $i=1,2,3$, $p_i : a_i = a_{i+1}$ for $i=1,2$, and $q : b_1 =^B_{p_1} b_2$, the
  function
  \[
    q \cto ({-}) : (b_2 =^B_{p_2} b_3) \to (b_1 =^B_{p_1\ct p_2} b_3)
  \]
  is an equivalence.
\end{lemma}

Now we are ready to derive the induction principle using the same technique as for the recursion principle.
Fix $P : \TorZ \to \UU$, $p_\pt : P(\pt)$, $p_\Zloop : p_\pt =^P_\Zloop p_\pt$.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:guided-null-hmtps-dep}
  For every $Z\defeq(X,f,t):\TorZ$, the type
  \[
    \sum_{p : P(Z)} \sum_{h : \prod_{x:X} p_\pt =^P_{s^Z_x} p} \prod_{x:X} h(x+1) =_! p_\Zloop \cto h(x)
  \]
  is contractible,
  where the $!$ denotes the proof of \cref{lem:loop-s-iterated}, a proposition.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $Z:\TorZ$. Since we are going to prove a proposition
  depending on the connected type $\TorZ$,
  we may take $Z\jdeq\pt\jdeq(\zet,s,!)$.

  The type under consideration is then the total space of the family $R : P(\pt) \to \UU$ defined by
  \[
    R(p) \defeq \sum_{h : \prod_{x:X} p_\pt =^P_{s^Z_x} p} \prod_{x:X} h(x+1) =_! p_\Zloop \cto h(x).
  \]
  Thus, to show that $Q_p(\zet,s)$ is contractible,
  it suffices to define an equivalence
  \[
    \varphi_p : R(p) \xrightarrow{\sim}{} (p_\pt = p)
  \]
  for each $p : P(\pt)$.
  We again invoke \cref{thm:integers-univ-symm},
  this time with the family $S_p : \zet \to \UU$ given by $S_p(z) \defeq (p_\pt =^P_{s^\pt_z} p)$
  and the equivalences $g_p : \prod_{z:\zet} S_p(z)\equiv S_p(z+1)$ given by
  $g_p(z) \defeq (p_\Zloop \cto ({-}))$.
\end{proof}
