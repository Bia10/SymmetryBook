# SymmetryBook
This book will be an undergraduate textbook written in the univalent style, taking advantage of the presence of symmetry in the logic at an early stage.

## Style guide

- An element of an identity type is called an *identification*, not a *path*.
- An element of a proposition can be called a *proof*.
