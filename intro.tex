  that all of mathematics was a tale about groups.
  I then told him about your program,
  which he didn't know about.

%{\em If this book is about group theory, then here we will explain what's interesting about groups and why one would want to study them.}

The book is about symmetry and its many manifestations in mathematics.
There are many kinds of symmetry and many ways of studying it.
Euclidean plane geometry is the study of properties that are invariant under rigid motions of the plane.
Other kinds of geometry arise by considering other notions of transformation.
Univalent mathematics gives another perspective.
Motions of the plane are a form of identifying the plane with itself.
It may also be useful to consider different planes
(for instance embedded in a common three-dimensional space)
and different identifications between them.
For instance, when drawing images in perspective
we identify planes in the scene with the image plane,
but not in a rigid Euclidean way, but
rather via a perspectivity (see Fig.~?).
This gives rise to projective geometry.

Does that mean that a plane from the point of view of Euclidean
geometry is not the same as a plane from the point of view of
projective or affine geometry?
Yes.
These are of different types,
because they have different notions of identification,
and thus they have different properties.

Propositions, sets, and $1$-types (groupoids).

Groupoids vs groups.
The type of all squares in a euclidean plane form a groupoid.
It is connected,
because between any two there exist identifications between them.
But there is no canonical identification.

When we say ``the symmetry group of the square'',
we can mean two things:
1) the symmetry group of a particular square;
this is indeed a group,
or 2) the connected groupoid of all squares;
this is a ``group up to conjugation''.

Vector spaces. Constructions and fields. Descartes and cartesian geometry.

Klein's EP:
\begin{quote}
  Given a manifold and a transformation group acting on it,
  to investigate those properties of figures on that manifold
  that are invariant under transformations of that group.
\end{quote}
and
\begin{quote}
  Given a manifold, and a transformation group acting on it,
  to study its \emph{invariants}.
\end{quote}
Invariant theory had previously been introduced in algebra
and studied by Clesch and Jordan.

(Mention continuity, differentiability, analyticity and Hilbert's 5th problem?)

Any finite automorphism group of the Riemann sphere is conjugate to a
rotation group (automorphism group of the Euclidean sphere).
[Dependency: diagonalizability] (Any complex representation of a
finite group is conjugate to a unitary representation.)

% Groups up to conjugation: $\Gal(\bar\Q/Q)$?

All of mathematics is a tale, not about groups,
but about $\infty$-groupoids.
However, a lot of the action happens already with groups.
